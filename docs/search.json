Several variables can impact salary, such as experience level, remote work, job title, company size, and geographical location. For organizations, knowing these factors can help in offering competitive salaries, while for professionals, it assists in career planning and salary negotiations. The dataset used in this analysis contains salary information for individuals working in the global AI and tech industry, spanning different roles, experience levels, employment types, and locations. The dataset includes data points such as salary (in both local currency and converted to USD), remote work ratios, company sizes, and the employee’s country of residence.

    "text": "Factors that affect salary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The box plot illustrates the relationship between experience levels and salary in the global AI and tech industry. Entry-level (EN) employees have the lowest median salary and the narrowest range, indicating a lower variation in earnings for junior positions. Executive-level (EX) employees exhibit the highest median salary and the largest salary range, reflecting a significant premium for leadership roles and strategic expertise. Mid-level (MI) salaries are slightly lower than Senior-level (SE) salaries but demonstrate a narrower range. Senior-level (SE) employees earn significantly more than entry-level (EN) positions and represent a bridge between managerial and technical expertise. The salary data aligns with industry norms where experience strongly correlates with potential salaries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Full-time employees earn the highest mean salary among all employment types. This is likely due to the stability and benefits associated with full-time roles. Contract workers have the second-highest mean salary. This reflects the premium often paid for specialized or short-term expertise. Freelancers earn the lowest mean salary, while part-time workers earn slightly more than freelancers but significantly less than full-time or contract workers. This could be due to fewer hours worked or the lack of long-term stability. The data suggests that the type of employment significantly impacts salary levels, with more stable employment types commanding higher pay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The average salary shows a steady increase from 2021 to 2024, with a particularly sharp rise between 2021 and 2022. The slower growth from 2023 to 2024 indicates a potential stabilization in salary increments. However, the slight decrease in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects the changing dynamics of the industry, which may be the impact of covid 19. The continuous increase in average salaries reflects the growing demand for skilled professionals in the AI and tech industry.\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable1: Salary Statistics by Company Size (Mean, Median, SD, Min, Max, Count)\n\n\ncompany_size\nM\nL\nS\n\n\nmean_salary\n160086.66\n152341.53\n87671.74\n\n\nmedian_salary\n150000\n136000\n74500\n\n\nsalary_sd\n72267.93\n68403.63\n57443.24\n\n\nmin_salary\n15000\n15000\n15809\n\n\nmax_salary\n800000\n423000\n416000\n\n\ncount\n51719\n1918\n204\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4:Medium-sized companies have the highest average salary ($160,086.66) among all company sizes, followed by large companies with an average salary of $152,341.53.

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nAccording to in-depth analysis, there are three main factors that affect salaries in the AI field: years of work experience, experience level, and employee type. As the field matures over time, salaries gradually increase, and as experience levels increase, from novice to department head, salaries also increase. Compared with part-time and freelance jobs, full-time jobs and contract workers are more professional and have higher barriers to entry, so salaries are relatively high.\nWhen studying the interaction between different factors that affect salary, I found something interesting. First, when analyzing the relationship between company size and experience level, small companies’ overall income level is not as good as that of medium and large companies. However, the average salary of their contract workers is higher than that of full-time employees, which is the opposite of medium and large companies. After research, I think there are two main reasons for this difference. On the one hand, contract workers’ positions usually lack stability, have no long-term employment security, and face higher career risks. In order to attract talents, small companies will offer higher salaries to compensate for this uncertainty. In addition, small companies may need contract workers to quickly fill technical vacancies for specific projects, so they are more willing to pay a premium. On the other hand, medium and large companies often offer attractive salaries in full-time positions to attract top talents, and increase total compensation through benefits, bonuses, and equity incentives. Contract workers usually cannot enjoy these additional benefits and their total income is lower than that of full-time employees.\nSecond, the interaction between years of work experience and company size is also worth noting. From 2021 to 2024, the average salary of all companies has increased, and the growth rate of medium and large companies is greater. However, in 2021, the salaries of medium and large companies have all declined, while small companies have grown rapidly in this year. This may be because in 2021, due to the epidemic, economic growth was slow, and medium and large companies took measures to cut salaries, while small companies, due to their small size, had a steady increase in average salaries."
