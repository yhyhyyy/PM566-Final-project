It is reasonable that income levels increase with experience levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCT: Contract, FL: Freelance, FT: Full-time, PT: Part-time\nFigure 2:Full-time job has the highest salary, the contract job has the second highest salary and freelance job has the lowest salary.

In both large and medium-sized companies, FT wages are higher than CT wages, but in small companies, CT salaries are higher than FT salaries This may be because small companies will offer short-term, high-paying contracts to attract employees when there are projects, while long-term employees are paid less than these contract workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5:The average salary of FT shows a steady growth trend, rising year by year from 2020 to 2024. In 2021, the average salary of CT shows a clear peak, which is much higher than other years. The salary levels of the two employment types of FL and PT remain relatively low throughout the period. The salary peak of CT in 2021 may reflect a temporary surge in demand in certain specific industries or economic environments, such as an increase in project-based work."
